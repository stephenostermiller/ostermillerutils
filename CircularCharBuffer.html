<h1><a name="circularcharbuffer">Circular Character Buffer</a></h1>

<p>Implements the circular buffer producer/consumer model for characters. 
Filling and emptying the buffer is done with standard Java Readers and Writers.</p>

<p>Using this class is a simpler alternative to using a PipedReader
and a PipedWriter. PipedReaders and PipedWriters don't support the
mark operation, don't allow you to control buffer sizes that they use,
and have a more complicated API that requires a instantiating two
classes and connecting them.</p>
 
<p>This class is similar to the <a href="CircularByteBuffer.html">CircularByteBuffer</a> which 
implements the circular buffer producer/consumer model for bytes and the <a href="CircularObjectBuffer.html">CircularObjectBuffer</a> which 
implements the circular buffer producer/consumer model for Objects.</p>
